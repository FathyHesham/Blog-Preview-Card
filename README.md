## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Through this project, I learned how to:

- Apply Flexbox effectively to create layouts
- Build a fully responsive card component
- Write clean and semantic HTML/CSS code

This challenge helped reinforce my understanding of responsive design and gave me a better feel for maintaining clean and readable code.

### Continued development

In the future, I would like to:

- Improve the overall UI and color palette
- Enhance the user experience
- Refactor and optimize the CSS further

### Useful resources

I tried to complete the challenge without external help so that others can give feedback on my code and I can learn from it. This approach pushed me to rely on my understanding and problem-solving skills.
